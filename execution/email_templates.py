"""
Email template storage and selection for interview notifications.

Contains all Colaberry interview notification templates and deterministic
logic for selecting the correct template based on interview sub-type.

Design principles:
- All templates defined as data (no logic in templates)
- Template selection is purely deterministic (no AI)
- Placeholders use {field_name} format
- Missing placeholders are detectable before sending
