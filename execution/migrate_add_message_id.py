"""
One-off, idempotent migration for the dashboard `emails` table.

Context
-------
`emails.email_id` was used as the dedup key when importing classified emails,
but it stores the IMAP *message sequence number* (1, 2, 3 ...), which every IMAP
session re-assigns. New emails collided with old rows, so `import_email_to_db()`
kept hitting its "already exists" branch (or, after the unique constraint was in
play, failed outright) and nothing was inserted after 2026-06-29.

This migration:
  1. adds `emails.message_id` (the RFC 5322 Message-ID header — stable, unique),
  2. makes the message_id index UNIQUE, and
  3. drops the bogus UNIQUE constraint on `emails.email_id`.

The same logic runs automatically on every processing run via
`process_inbox_auto._ensure_schema()`; this script just lets you apply it now,
by hand, against production.

Safe to run repeatedly. Works on PostgreSQL (Neon) and SQLite.

Usage
