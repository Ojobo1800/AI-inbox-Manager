"""
Student resolution execution script.

Identifies which student an incoming interview email is about by examining
email headers to find the original recipient (the student's assigned Gmail).

All student Gmail accounts forward/route their emails to c_interviews@colaberry.com.
This script reverses that routing to identify the student.

Design principles:
- Pure logic separated from I/O for testability
- Deterministic header parsing (no AI)
- Multiple fallback strategies for student identification
