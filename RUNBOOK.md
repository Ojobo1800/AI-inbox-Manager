## 0. TL;DR — what changed from older docs

Earlier versions of this runbook (and stale chat sessions) describe infrastructure
that **is no longer in use**. Current reality:

| Thing | ❌ OLD (ignore) | ✅ CURRENT |
|---|---|---|
| Scheduler | Windows Task Scheduler on a laptop | **GitHub Actions cron**, cloud, laptop-independent |
| Backend host | Railway | **Render** (Docker web service) |
| Database | Railway PostgreSQL | **Neon PostgreSQL** (free tier, never expires) |
| Backend URL | `inboxgenius-api-production.up.railway.app` | `https://ai-inbox-manager-5l6p.onrender.com` |
| "Laptop must be on" | true | **false** — everything runs in the cloud |
| Student notifications | auto-emailed by the cron | **draft → human approval** in the dashboard |
| Classifier model | (unclear) | `gpt-4o-mini` (see [§11](#11-cost)) |

The frontend URL (`https://ai-inbox-manager-vert.vercel.app`) and the Gmail
account (`c_interviews@colaberry.com`) are unchanged.

---

## 1. Live URLs & accounts

| Component | URL / location |
|---|---|
| **Dashboard (frontend)** | https://ai-inbox-manager-vert.vercel.app — Vercel, auto-deploys from `master` |
| **Backend API** | https://ai-inbox-manager-5l6p.onrender.com — Render Docker web service `inboxgenius-api` |
| **API health** | https://ai-inbox-manager-5l6p.onrender.com/health → `{"status":"healthy","database":"connected"}` |
| **API docs (OpenAPI)** | https://ai-inbox-manager-5l6p.onrender.com/docs |
| **Database** | Neon PostgreSQL — host `ep-super-shadow-aqsoxad0.c-8.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech`, db `neondb` |
| **Scheduler / CI** | https://github.com/Ojobo1800/AI-inbox-Manager/actions |
| **Git repo** | https://github.com/Ojobo1800/AI-inbox-Manager (branch: `master`) |
| **Monitored mailbox** | `c_interviews@colaberry.com` (Gmail, IMAP + SMTP) |
| **Google Sheet audit log** | id in `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID` secret |

**Dashboard logins:** `admin` / `admin123` (full), stakeholder account view-only.
Passwords are bcrypt hashes in Render env vars `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` /
`STAKEHOLDER_PASSWORD_HASH`.

---

## 2. Architecture (Agent-First, Deterministic-Execution — see `CLAUDE.md`)

```
Layer 1  /directives          Human-readable SOPs. Claude reads before acting.
Layer 2  Claude / engineer    Plans & edits. Never runs business logic itself.
Layer 3  /execution           Deterministic Python scripts — the actual work.
         .github/workflows     "The worker": GH Actions runs Layer 3 on a schedule.
Dashboard services/dashboard   React (Vercel) + FastAPI (Render) + Neon, read-mostly view.
```

The **cron running `execution/process_inbox_auto.py` every 2 h is the production
system.** The dashboard only *reads* what that script writes (plus a human
approval queue for student notifications).

---

## 3. The processing pipeline — what one run does

Entry point: `python execution/process_inbox_auto.py`
(function `process_unread_emails()` in that file).

1. **Acquire run-lock** (`execution/run_lock.py`, lock at `tmp/process.lock`) — no
   overlapping runs.
2. **Spam-review 2nd pass** (`_run_spam_review_pass`): fetch everything in the
   `Spam Review` Gmail folder (≤50), re-classify each:
   - still `Other` / confidence < 0.70 / flagged spam → **permanently deleted**
     (`delete_emails`, UID-scoped `UID EXPUNGE`)
   - turns out legit → **rescued** to its real category folder
3. **Fetch INBOX**: `UNSEEN` only, **newest-first**, capped at
   `MAX_EMAILS_PER_RUN` (default **100**). Handles are **IMAP UIDs**.
4. **Pre-run budget check**: abort before any API call if
   `len(emails) × ~$0.015 > MAX_COST_PER_RUN_USD` (default `5.0`).
   ⚠️ that per-email estimate uses gpt-4o pricing but the model is gpt-4o-mini —
   it over-estimates ~17× (see [§15](#15-known-issues--deferred-work)).
5. **Classify** (16 parallel workers):
   - `pre_classify_by_sender()` — deterministic sender-domain rules, **no AI call**
     for obvious senders (LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.)
   - else `classify_email()` → OpenAI **`gpt-4o-mini`** → category + confidence +
     extracted fields + edge-case flags
6. **Post-classification cost check**: if actual token cost > limit, DB writes
   still happen but **all Gmail moves/deletes are skipped** this run.
7. **Apply actions** (sequential) per email:
   - **Genuine interview request** OR **sender/company in `KNOWN_INTERVIEW_COMPANIES`**
     → **kept in INBOX, untouched**. Imported to DB; `process_interview_email()`
     runs: sub-classify → create `InterviewEvent` → resolve student from
     `config/students.py` → create a **`NotificationDraft`** (NOT auto-sent).
   - **`Other`** → quarantine: apply label `Spam Review`, remove from inbox,
     import to DB.
   - **Everything else** → organize: `CATEGORY_TO_FOLDER` map; if confidence <
     `ROUTING_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` (0.70) or category unmapped → `Needs Review`;
     else the mapped folder.
8. **Move** (`fetch_emails.move_emails`): for each message, a single
   `UID MOVE <uid> <folder>` (RFC 6851), addressed by **UID**, with
   **Message-ID re-resolution** if a UID has shifted. No COPY / `\Deleted` /
   `expunge()` in this path — it cannot delete mail.
   ⚠️ **Do not revert this to `STORE +X-GM-LABELS` / `STORE -X-GM-LABELS
   (\Inbox)`** — that was the approach from 2026-09-08 to 2026-09-15 and its
   label-removal half is a *silent no-op* on this account: it returns `OK` but
   never removes the message from Inbox (see [§16](#16-changelog-infra--architecture-only)).
9. **Google Sheets** audit log (filtered subset of categories).
10. **SharePoint** audit log (if configured; usually a no-op).
11. **`ProcessRun`** row written to Neon; `summary.json` saved under
    `tmp/auto_process_<ts>/`; logs uploaded as a GH Actions artifact
    (`inbox-logs-<run#>`, 7-day retention).
12. On fatal error: `send_failure_alert()` emails `ALERT_EMAIL_TO`. Script always
    `sys.exit(0)` so the scheduler reports success.

**Categories → Gmail folders/labels:** see `CATEGORY_TO_FOLDER` in
`execution/process_inbox_auto.py` (~line 584). All flat label names.
**Confidence threshold:** `ROUTING_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.70`.

---

## 4. Scheduling & GitHub Actions workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/process_inbox.yml` | cron `0 */2 * * *` (every 2 h UTC) + manual `workflow_dispatch` | Installs deps, writes `.env` + `config/*.json` from secrets, runs `process_inbox_auto.py`, refreshes the `GMAIL_TOKEN_JSON` secret with the rotated token, uploads logs. `timeout-minutes: 30`. |
| `.github/workflows/keepalive.yml` | cron `17 6 * * 1` (Mon 06:17 UTC) + manual | Pushes one empty `chore: keepalive [skip ci]` commit/week so GitHub never auto-disables the cron (it did on ~2026-08-25 after 60 days idle). |
| `.github/workflows/deploy_backend.yml` | push to `master` touching `services/dashboard/api/**`, `execution/**`, or `config/**` + manual | `curl`s the Render deploy hook (`RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL` secret). |

**Frontend deploy:** Vercel watches `master` and rebuilds
`services/dashboard/frontend/` automatically. Prod API URL is baked in via
`services/dashboard/frontend/.env.production`
(`VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://ai-inbox-manager-5l6p.onrender.com`).

**Local Windows Task Scheduler** job `ColaberryEmailProcessing` — **DISABLED on
purpose.** Re-enable only if the cloud cron dies. `InboxAI_StartAPI_OnLogon`
(starts a local API on logon) is harmless and still active.

---

## 5. Data stores

| Store | Holds | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Gmail labels/folders** | the actual sorted result the assistant sees | source of truth for "where is this email" |
| **Neon PostgreSQL** (`neondb`) | `emails`, `classifications`, `process_runs`, `interview_events`, `notification_drafts`, `students`, approvals, checklist… | powers the dashboard. Dedup key = RFC 5322 `Message-ID` (`emails.message_id` UNIQUE). `_ensure_schema()` in `process_inbox_auto.py` auto-migrates on run. |
| **Google Sheet** | flat human-readable audit log | filtered; failures are non-blocking |
| **GH Actions artifacts** | per-run `logs/` | 7-day retention |
| `tmp/auto_process_<ts>/summary.json` | per-run stats | local/CI only, disposable |

**Connection string** lives in the `DATABASE_URL` GitHub secret (processing) and
the `DATABASE_URL` Render env var (API). Both point at the same Neon external URL
(`...neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require`).

---

## 6. Frontend UI

`services/dashboard/frontend/` — **React 18 + TypeScript + Vite 5**, routing via
`react-router-dom` 6, charts via `recharts`, HTTP via `axios`
(`src/api/client.ts`, base URL from `VITE_API_BASE_URL`). Cookie-session auth
(`/api/auth/login` sets a cookie; there is no bearer token).

| Route | Page component | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/login` | `LoginPage.tsx` | admin / stakeholder login |
| `/` | `DashboardPage.tsx` | stats, category chart, volume trends, countdown to next interview |
| `/interviews` | `InterviewsPage.tsx` | interview requests & events |
| `/interview-events` | `InterviewEventsReportPage.tsx` | interview-events report |
| `/reports` | `ReportsPage.tsx` | analytics tabs (accuracy, categories, hourly volume, company tracker, engineering KPIs) |
| `/review` | `ReviewPage.tsx` | `Needs Review` queue + pending **notification drafts** to approve/edit/reject |
| `/settings` | `SettingsPage.tsx` | schedule config, thresholds |

Shared shell: `components/Layout.tsx`. Other components: `ApprovalsContent`,
`InboxContent`, `InterviewChecklist`, `CountdownTimer`, `ErrorBoundary`.

---

## 7. Backend API

`services/dashboard/api/` — **FastAPI**, `uvicorn main:app`, Python 3.11,
SQLAlchemy 2 + `psycopg2` → Neon. Deployed as a Render Docker web service
(`Dockerfile.prod`, non-root, healthcheck on `/health`, port 8000 → Render `$PORT`).
`render.yaml` documents the service; env vars with `sync: false` are set by hand
in the Render dashboard.

Routers (all under `/api`, see `main.py`): `auth`, `approvals`, `inbox`, `stats`,
`whitelist`, `emails`, `interviews`, `notifications`, `checklist`, `schedule`.
CORS `allow_origins` = `CORS_ORIGINS` env var (must exactly match the Vercel URL,
no trailing slash).

> **Manual move/delete from the dashboard is disabled in the cloud** —
> `services/dashboard/api/integration/email_actions.py` catches the missing IMAP
> libs and raises "IMAP actions not available in cloud deployment". All Gmail
> mutation happens in the cron.

---

## 8. Secrets & credentials

**Nothing secret is committed.** `.gitignore` covers `.env`, `config/gmail_token.json`,
`config/gmail_credentials.json`, `config/service-account-key.json`, `*.db`, `logs/`.

### GitHub repo secrets (`Ojobo1800/AI-inbox-Manager` → Settings → Secrets → Actions)
`DATABASE_URL`, `EMAIL_ADDRESS`, `EMAIL_PASSWORD`, `EMAIL_SERVER`, `EMAIL_PORT`,
`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `SMTP_APP_PASSWORD`, `ALERT_EMAIL_TO`, `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID`,
`GMAIL_TOKEN_JSON` (base64, auto-refreshed each run), `GMAIL_CREDENTIALS_JSON`
(base64), `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_JSON` (base64), `RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL`,
`PAT_FOR_SECRETS` (PAT used to write `GMAIL_TOKEN_JSON` back).
`gh secret list` to enumerate.

### Render env vars (`inboxgenius-api` → Environment)
`DATABASE_URL`, `ENVIRONMENT=production`, `SESSION_SECRET`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`,
`STAKEHOLDER_PASSWORD_HASH`, `CORS_ORIGINS`, `EMAIL_ADDRESS`, `EMAIL_PASSWORD`,
`OPENAI_API_KEY`.

### Rotation

- **OpenAI key** — new key at platform.openai.com → update `OPENAI_API_KEY` in
  **both** the GitHub secret and the Render env var. (Charges bill to whichever
  OpenAI account owns the key — not necessarily the GitHub owner.)
- **Gmail OAuth** (`config/gmail_token.json`) — auto-refreshes via the stored
  refresh token; the cron writes the refreshed token back to `GMAIL_TOKEN_JSON`.
  Full re-auth only if Google revokes: `python scripts/authorize_gmail.py`, sign
  in as `c_interviews@colaberry.com`, then base64 the new
  `config/gmail_token.json` into the `GMAIL_TOKEN_JSON` secret.
- **DB** — rotate in Neon console, update `DATABASE_URL` in the GitHub secret and
  the Render env var.
- **Dashboard password** — `python -c "from services.dashboard.api.auth import
  hash_password; print(hash_password('newpw'))"` → paste hash into the Render env
  var → Render redeploys.

---

## 9. Safety mechanisms

- **Run-lock** — `tmp/process.lock`, no concurrent runs.
- **Known-interview-company protection** — `KNOWN_INTERVIEW_COMPANIES` set; a
  match on company / sender / subject forces "keep in INBOX" even if the AI
  misclassifies.
- **Confidence gate** — < 0.70 routes to `Needs Review`, never the target folder.
- **Two-pass spam** — `Other` is quarantined in `Spam Review`, only deleted after
  a second AI confirmation on the next run.
- **Cost guardrails** — pre-run estimate abort + post-run actual-cost skip of
  Gmail mutations. Env: `MAX_COST_PER_RUN_USD` (default 5.0).
- **Batch ceiling** — `MAX_EMAILS_PER_RUN` (default 100).
- **`MOVE`-only organize path** — cannot permanently delete mail (no
  `\Deleted`/`expunge()`); the only hard delete is the confirmed-spam purge,
  and it is UID-scoped (`UID EXPUNGE`), never a blind `expunge()`.
- **UID + Message-ID addressing** — moves/deletes can't hit the wrong message
  when sequence numbers shift (see changelog 2026-09-08).
- **Never trust an IMAP `OK` alone** — `STORE ±X-GM-LABELS` on `\Inbox`
  returned `OK` for two weeks while doing nothing (2026-09-15 incident). If you
  change the move/delete mechanism again, verify actual mailbox state changed,
  not just the response code.
- **Failure alerts** — `send_failure_alert()` → `ALERT_EMAIL_TO` on fatal errors
  / cost aborts.

## 10. Common operations

```bash
# --- Trigger a processing run now (instead of waiting for the 2h cron) ---
gh workflow run process_inbox.yml --ref master
gh run watch $(gh run list --workflow=process_inbox.yml -L1 --json databaseId -q '.[0].databaseId')

# --- Inspect the last runs / a run's log ---

#   frontend: cd services/dashboard/frontend && npm run dev   (http://localhost:5173)
#   one processing run locally (needs root .env): python execution/process_inbox_auto.py --limit 10

# --- Lock recovery (only relevant for local runs) ---
cat tmp/process.lock            # PID + timestamp
rm tmp/process.lock             # if the PID is dead / lock > 3h old
```

---

## 11. Cost

- Model: **`gpt-4o-mini`** (`execution/classify_email.py`, `call_claude_api`
  default; `classify_email()` does not override it).
- Deterministic `pre_classify_by_sender()` skips the API entirely for many
  emails.
- Real spend ≈ **$0.10–0.15 per run** (~800k input + ~15k output tokens at
  gpt-4o-mini rates) → **~$1.50–2.00/day** across 12 runs.
- The **`estimated cost: $X` line in the logs over-states this ~17×** because
  `_compute_cost()` in `process_inbox_auto.py` hard-codes gpt-4o pricing
  ($2.50 / $10 per M) instead of gpt-4o-mini ($0.15 / $0.60 per M). Safe (fails
  toward aborting), but misleading — see [§15](#15-known-issues--deferred-work).
- Charges bill to the OpenAI account that owns the key in the `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  secret. Verify the account at platform.openai.com → Billing/Usage.

## 12. Failure playbook

| Symptom | First checks |
|---|---|
| **Dashboard shows no / stale data** | `curl .../health` → is `database` `connected`? Is Render awake (cold start ≈ 20 s)? `gh run list` — are cron runs green? Check a run log for `Dashboard ProcessRun record created`. |
| **Emails not being sorted** | `gh run view <id> --log` → look for `Successfully moved N of N`, `Move: … skipping`, `BAD Could not parse command`. ⚠️ A clean `Successfully moved 100 of 100` log line is **not proof** — check the actual Inbox count too (via IMAP or `inbox_count` in `/api/stats/summary`); the 2026-09-15 incident had this exact log line every run for two weeks while nothing left Inbox. Confirm `EMAIL_PASSWORD` / Gmail OAuth still valid (`AUTHENTICATE failed` / `invalid_grant`). |
| **Cron not running at all** | GH Actions → is "Process Inbox" **disabled**? (re-enable; keepalive should prevent this). Check `keepalive` ran in the last week. |
| **Cost guardrail aborting** | Log shows `COST GUARDRAIL`. Real cost is ~17× lower than the estimate — usually safe to raise `MAX_COST_PER_RUN_USD` (GitHub secret / `.env`) or reduce inbox backlog. Fixing [§15](#15-known-issues--deferred-work) removes the false alarm. |
| **OpenAI errors** | status.openai.com for outage. `401` → rotate key ([§8](#8-secrets--credentials)). `429` → lower `MAX_EMAILS_PER_RUN`. Affected emails stay UNSEEN for next run. |
| **Gmail OAuth expired** | `python scripts/authorize_gmail.py` → re-base64 into `GMAIL_TOKEN_JSON`. SMTP alerts also fail during this window. |
| **Backend deploy failed** | GH Actions `Deploy Backend to Render` log; Render dashboard → `inboxgenius-api` → Events / Logs. |
| **Run crashed, lock stuck (local only)** | `rm tmp/process.lock` if PID dead or > 3 h old. |
| **`Spam Review` / `Needs Review` errors** | folder names must be quoted in IMAP — `_quote_folder()` in `fetch_emails.py` handles this; if it regresses you'll see `BAD Could not parse command`. |

---

## 13. Directives (Layer 1 SOPs)

`directives/email-integration.md` — IMAP fetch/move/delete rules (UID handling,
label ops, folder quoting — **step 7 is the authority on the move pipeline**).
`directives/email-classification.md` — categories & classification rules.
`directives/interview-processing.md` — interview sub-classification & notifications.

---

## 14. Verify this doc is still current

Run these; if any disagree with the above, **the doc is stale — update it**:

```bash
# Backend host & DB (expect onrender.com + "database":"connected")
curl -s https://ai-inbox-manager-5l6p.onrender.com/health

# Scheduler is the GH Actions cron, running & green
gh run list --workflow=process_inbox.yml -L 3

# Production entrypoint is still process_inbox_auto.py
grep -n "process_inbox_auto.py" .github/workflows/process_inbox.yml

# Classifier model
grep -n 'model: str = ' execution/classify_email.py

# DB target (expect a neon.tech URL in the secret; can't print value, but:)
gh secret list | grep DATABASE_URL

# Frontend prod API URL
cat services/dashboard/frontend/.env.production
```

**Known stale files still in the repo (do not treat as current):**
`services/dashboard/api/railway.json`, `services/dashboard/README.md`,
`services/dashboard/QUICKSTART.md`, `services/dashboard/FULLSTACK_QUICKSTART.md`,
and the `# Railway…` comments in `services/dashboard/api/database.py` (the
`postgres://` → `postgresql://` normalization there is still valid). Deployment
config that *is* live: `render.yaml` + `services/dashboard/api/Dockerfile.prod`.

---

## 15. Known issues & deferred work

- **Cost estimate is ~17× too high.** `_compute_cost()` /
  `_EST_COST_PER_EMAIL_USD` in `process_inbox_auto.py` use gpt-4o pricing while
  the model is gpt-4o-mini. Fix: use gpt-4o-mini rates ($0.15 / $0.60 per M) or
  read the model from one constant. Low risk, avoids false cost-guardrail aborts.
- **Interview / known-company emails are re-classified every run.** They're kept
  UNSEEN in INBOX on purpose, so each 2 h run re-fetches and re-classifies them.
  Deferred fix: stamp a durable `InboxGenius-Processed` Gmail label and exclude
  it from the fetch search (`fetch_emails.search_emails` already accepts
  `exclude_gm_labels`, just not wired to the caller).
- **`email_actions.delete_email()` defaults `folder="INBOX"`** — a dashboard
  delete of a non-inbox email now safely no-ops with a warning (previously could
  hit the wrong message). Pass the real folder if this path is ever re-enabled.
- **The mislabelled backlog from the Sept 2026 incident** keeps its junk labels
  in Gmail; the fix stopped new damage but didn't retro-clean. A one-off
  label-stripping script can be written if needed.
- **Inbox backlog from the 2026-09-15 incident.** ~2,700+ unread messages
  accumulated while the move step silently failed for two weeks. The fix
  (§16) makes every *new* run's moves actually work, but draining the backlog
  at `MAX_EMAILS_PER_RUN=100` per ~2–6 h run will take days. Consider a
  temporary bump to `MAX_EMAILS_PER_RUN` (real cost is ~17× lower than the
  guardrail estimate, see above) to drain it faster, then set it back.
- **GH Actions scheduled runs fire every 3–7 h, not every 2 h.** The cron is
  `0 */2 * * *`, but observed gaps between consecutive runs are consistently
  longer — GitHub delays/throttles scheduled (as opposed to `workflow_dispatch`)
  triggers under load, and there's no SLA on exact timing. Budget for this when
  estimating how fast the Inbox drains or how fresh dashboard data is.

---

## 16. Changelog (infra / architecture only)

- **2026-09-15** — Organize-path move mechanism switched from
  `STORE +X-GM-LABELS` / `STORE -X-GM-LABELS (\Inbox)` to a single `UID MOVE`
  (RFC 6851). The two-step label approach (introduced 2026-09-08 below) always
  returned `OK` but its label-removal half was a **silent no-op** on this Gmail
  account — messages got correctly labeled and never left Inbox. Reported
  repeatedly by ops (2026-09-01, 09, 11, 13) and escalated 2026-09-15; root-
  caused via direct IMAP testing against the live mailbox (confirmed the no-op
  on two independent messages via a fresh connection, and separately confirmed
  `\Deleted`+expunge from Inbox strips all labels and moves to Trash on this
  account — tested and rejected as the fix). `UID MOVE` verified end-to-end
  against real stuck mail before deploying. Inbox had backlogged to ~2,700+
  unread by the time this was fixed (see [§15](#15-known-issues--deferred-work)).
  Commit on `master`; tests in `tests/execution/test_fetch_emails.py`;
  `directives/email-integration.md` v1.3.
- **2026-09-08** — Move/delete pipeline switched from IMAP sequence numbers to
  **UIDs + Gmail label ops** (`+X-GM-LABELS` / `-X-GM-LABELS \Inbox`), with
  Message-ID re-resolution and UID-scoped spam expunge. Folder names quoted in
  `SELECT` (revived the long-dead spam-review 2nd pass). Newest-first INBOX
  fetch. Root cause: stale sequence numbers across two connections →
  wrong labels, mail stuck in Inbox, 300+ backlog. Commit on `master`; tests in
  `tests/execution/test_fetch_emails.py`. Full rewrite of this runbook.
- **2026-08-31** — `emails.message_id` UNIQUE column; DB dedup keyed on
  `Message-ID` not sequence number (fixed the 2026-06-29 → 08-31 dashboard
  freeze). `keepalive.yml` added. Cron re-enabled after 60-day auto-disable.
  `DATABASE_URL` GitHub secret corrected from Railway → Neon.
- **2026-06-03** — Migrated backend Render + DB **Railway → Neon**
  (Render's free PostgreSQL expired). Backend moved to Render Docker.
- **2026-06-27** — Two-pass Spam Review system added.
- (pre-2026-06) — Railway backend + Windows Task Scheduler era. **Deprecated.**
